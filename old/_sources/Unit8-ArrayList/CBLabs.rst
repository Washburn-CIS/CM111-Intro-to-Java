The |Data Lab|, a new AP CS A Lab released in 2019, was seen in Unit 5. The third part of this lab, Activity 3, can be used here for more practice with ArrayLists. The teacher guide and the code files are available in the AP Course Audit Portal. This page will eventually include tips to complete the labs.
