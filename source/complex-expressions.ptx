        <title>Arithmetic Expressions</title>
    
    <p>
        Expressions can be combined together to form a larger, more complex, compound expression. To combine two expressions, a <term>binary operator</term> is placed between them. The operator performs some function over the values that the two expressions evaluate to (these values are called <term>operands</term>). For instance, + is a binary operator representing the addition operation. <c>5</c> is a numeric console> expression, and <c>5 + 5</c> is a more complex, compound expression using the addition operator that evaluates to the value <c>10</c>. 
    </p>

    There are several binary arithmetic operators which work over numeric expressions in Java. Each is described below:
        <dl>
            <li>
                <p><c>+</c> (the addition operator)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><c>-</c> (the subtraction operator)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><c>*</c> (the multiplication operator)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><c>/</c> (the division operator)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><c>%</c> (the modulus operator)</p>
            </li>
    </dl>

Note that, when using the <c>/</c> operator with integers, you get back the integer quotient (rather than a floating point value). Modulus gives you the remainder when performing integer division. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        There is also a unary operator in Java. This is an operator that works over only one operand rather than two. This is the negation operator, which, like subtraction, is represented with <c>-</c>. For instance, <c>-5</c> is a compound expression that is the negation of 5. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Also similar to algebra, note that these operators follow the same order of precedence. Multiplication and division are evaluated before addition an subtraction. For example, <c>2 * 3 + 1</c> is equal to <c>7</c>, not <c>8</c>. 
    </p>
    <p>You can also use parentheses to force a certain order of evaluation for your expressions, just as you did in algebra. For example, the expression <c>2 * (3 + 1)</c> does, in fact, evaluate to <c>>8</c>.
