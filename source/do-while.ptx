        <title>do-while Loops</title>
    
      <p>
        The <term>do-while statement</term> is a loop statement in which the looping condition occurs after the loop body. 
        The <c>do-while</c> loop is designed for solving problems in which at least one iteration must occur -- the looping condition 
        is not evaluated until after the body of the loop is executed once. 
      </p>
      <p>
      
      A do-while loop begins with the <code>do</code> keyword followed by a block of code surrounded by curly braces. At the end of the curly braces is
      the <code>while</code> keyword followed by a boolean expression (the looping condition) in parentheses. Unlike many other loops, a semicolon is required to terminate the statement.
