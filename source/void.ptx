        <title>Methods with No Return Type</title>
    
    
    <p>
Not every method will need to return a value. This section will look at at one possible rationale for writing such a method.

        <title>The void Keyword</title>
        <p>
            Though not every method has a return value, method definitions require \textit{something} in the place of the return type in the method definition header. If no value is returned by the method, the \textbf{void} keyword is used to indicate such. If you use the void keyword in your method definition, you are not required to have a return statement in your method definition. Thus, the following is legal:
        </p>
        
<program language="java"><input>
void methodWithNoReturnStatement() {
// this method literally does nothing
}
</input></program>
