        <title>Command-Line Arguments</title>
    
    <p>
Though you should understand what the type <c>String[]</c> means at this point (an array of string values), it may not be clear why a parameter with this type must be provided to the main method. The purpose of this parameter is to hold any <term>command-line arguments</term> that may be provided to your application when it is started at the command prompt. This would allow you to write an application similar to <em>javac</em> itself!
    </p>
    <p>
Consider the following example program:
    </p>
<program language="java"><input>
<xi:include href="../../examples/code/CommandLineDemo.java" parse="text"/>
</input></program>

    <p>
    This application prints out each of the command line arguments given to it when it is executed. These arguments are specified at the end of the <em>java</em> command that starts the JRE.
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, if you were to compile and run this program with the following command:
    </p>
<console>
    <input>
    java CommandLineDemo here are some arguments
  </input>
</console>
    <p>
    ...the following would be printed to the screen:
    </p>

<console>
<output>
here
are
some
arguments
</output><!-- TODO: check to see if this renders correctly /-->
</console>
